# Project Description

## Topic
Analysis of Object-Oriented Programming Languages Popularity and Developer Trends.

This project studies how popular object-oriented programming languages (such as Python, Java, and C++) are among developers and how factors like experience relate to compensation.

## Hypotheses
- Python is one of the most widely used object-oriented programming languages.
- Developers with more experience tend to earn higher salaries.
- The popularity of Python has increased over time.

## Data Source
- **Stack Overflow Developer Survey**
- Source: Kaggle (public dataset)
- Format: CSV
- Description: Annual survey data containing information about developers, programming languages used, experience, salary, and demographics.

## Methodology
- Load and clean the dataset
- Store and manipulate data using Python classes (OOP)
- Visualize comparisons, relationships, and time-based trends
- Interpret insights based on the exploratory analysis

## Notes
The dataset and hypotheses may evolve as further analysis is conducted.
